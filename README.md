# KIMU — Keep It Minimal UI

**KIMU** is a lightweight, minimal, modular, and flexible **front-end framework** designed to create poetic, elegant, **extensible** and efficient user interfaces with minimal effort and overhead.

It is built with a focus on **simplicity**, **intention**, **lightness**, **clarity**, meaningful **interactions** and human-centered **experiences** — where less is more.

Based on **Web Components**, with no external dependencies, declarative and dynamic by design.  

Created for anyone who wants to build applications that are light, elegant, alive.
For those who design with **intention**.  
For those who build with **care**.  
Not just tools, but spaces. Not just components, but extensions of thought.

> _“Each extension is a thought. Each interface is a gesture.”_

Created by **Marco Di Pasquale** (aka *Hocram*), [UnicòVerso](https://unicoverso.com): to create lightweight, elegant and reactive web interfaces.

🚀 **Get started now:**  
> <img src="icon.svg" alt="KIMU Icon" width="24" style="vertical-align: middle;" /> Use the [`kimu-core`](https://github.com/unicoverso/kimu-core) repository as a base to develop your KIMU application. You'll find everything you need to create extensions, modules, and start a minimal project.

## 🌿 Philosophy

`KIMU` encourages a design and development approach where every element has a reason to exist. No bloat, no unnecessary complexity — just pure functionality, elegantly presented.

`KIMU` follows the principle of essentialism:  
- Every element exists because it has meaning.  
- Every interaction is designed for clarity.  
- Complexity is embraced only when it serves the user.

- **Modular by nature** – each piece can be added, removed, or combined  
- **Minimal by choice** – only what is needed  
- **Human by vocation** – interfaces are a form of relationship
  

> "No bloat.  
> No distractions.  
> Pure, meaningful interfaces."

## 🧩 The heart of KIMU: `KIMU-CORE`

[`KIMU-CORE`](https://github.com/unicoverso/kimu-core) is the core of the framework:  
a small, open engine, ready to be extended with modules that follow a philosophy of  
**lightness, clarity, harmony**.

It offers everything you need to launch, load and orchestrate modular extensions, declarative interfaces, reactive behaviors and shared styles.

- No forced dependencies  
- Every component is an extension  
- Everything adapts to what’s needed — and nothing more

> Every interface becomes a living ecosystem, made of modular elements that speak, grow, and merge.
