# 🌬️ KIMU — Keep It Minimal UI

**KIMU** is a lightweight, minimal, and modular front-end framework for building **poetic and extensible interfaces**.  
Based on **Web Components**, with no external dependencies, declarative and dynamic by design.  
For those who design with **intention**. For those who build with **care**.  
Created for anyone who wants to build applications that are light, elegant, alive.  
Not just tools, but spaces. Not just components, but extensions of thought.

> _“Each extension is a thought. Each interface is a gesture.”_

## 🧠 What is KIMU

KIMU is a **web-native front-end framework**, designed to create modular applications, subtle interfaces, and flexible environments.

- 🔹 Native **Web Components**  
- 🔹 **No external dependencies**  
- 🔹 **Dynamic extensions**, isolated and self-loading  
- 🔹 **Declarative system**, lightweight and composable  
- 🔹 **Modular structure**, guided by a clear and readable philosophy

> _“It does not impose: it accompanies. It does not shout: it breathes.”_

## 🧩 The heart: `kimu-core`

[`kimu-core`](https://github.com/unicoverso/kimu-core) is the core of the framework:  
a small, open engine, ready to be extended with modules that follow a philosophy of  
**lightness, clarity, harmony**.

It offers everything you need to launch, load and orchestrate modular extensions, declarative interfaces, reactive behaviors and shared styles.

- No forced dependencies  
- Every component is an extension  
- Everything adapts to what’s needed — and nothing more

> Every interface becomes a living ecosystem, made of modular elements that speak, grow, and merge.

## 🔍 Philosophy

KIMU is born from a vision:

> _To build not just code,_  
> _but lightweight tools to touch the digital world with humanity._

- **Modular by nature** – each piece can be added, removed, or combined  
- **Minimal by choice** – only what is needed  
- **Human by vocation** – interfaces are a form of relationship
